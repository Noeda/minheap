Min-heap implementation for C
=============================

This is the simplest[1] min-heap implementation ever for C. It's implemented
using a binary heap[2]. It also uses C11[3]. It has incredibly minimal API
(just look at that heap.h file!). This library can and will solve world
hunger[4]. Also somewhat promisingly it looks like it can cure cancer[5].

But most importantly you can use it to implement/use it as a priority queue in
C like I'm doing for my stupid hobby programming stuff which involves lots of
Haskell and stuff.

Notes
-----

[1] Is probably not actually the simplest.

[2] I hope you are not one of THOSE people who think you are not a real coder
unless your heaps are fibonacci heaps. If you ARE then...then........you can go
away or something. I'm perfectly fine with a binary heap thank you very much.

[3] Okay it uses just one little feature of C11 in one place (static assert)
but do you really judge C code based on how many C11 features it uses? HUH?
DENNIS RITCHIE WOULD NOT APPROVE

[4] Doesn't actually solve world hunger.

[5] Doesn't actually cure cancer.
